# PowerBI_DAX_Specific
These projects demonstrate my experience and proficiency in using DAX within Power BI to create dynamic, insightful, and interactive business intelligence solutions.
The use cases span across various domains such as sales analysis, performance tracking, KPI dashboards, and more.
I've created Custom Measures & Calculated Columns
Built dynamic KPIs using DAX, including:
  - Total Sales
  - Total Orders
  - Average Order Value
  - Growth vs. Previous Month
Time Intelligence Functions Used `DATEADD()`, `TOTALYTD()`, `MONTH()`, and `WEEKDAY()` DAX functions to calculate:
  - Month-over-month sales
  - Year-to-date sales
  - Day-of-week performance
Logical Functions using DAX
DAX operators
Used `CALCULATE()`, `FILTER()`, and `SUM()` 
Excel/CSV files as data sources
